Multidimensional Arrays
A multidimensional array is an array containing one or more arrays.
To create a two-dimensional array, add each array within its own set of curly braces:
Example
int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };
myNumbers is now an array with two arrays as its elements.
To access the elements of the myNumbers array, specify two indexes: one for the array, and one for the element inside that array. 
This example accesses the third element (2) in the second array (1) of myNumbers:
Example
int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };
int x = myNumbers[1][2];
System.out.println(x); // Outputs 7
We can also use a for loop inside another for loop to get the elements of a two-dimensional array (we still have to point to the two indexes):
