Difference between Inheritance and aggregation-------
Aggregation in Java is a relationship between two classes that is best described as a "has-a" and "whole/part" relationship. 
The aggregate class contains a reference to another class and is said to have ownership of that class. 
Each class referenced is considered to be part-of the aggregate class.

Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another.
 With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.
 The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class) and 
 the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).
Inheritance is nothing but is-a relationship.

extends is the keyword used to inherit the properties of a class.
